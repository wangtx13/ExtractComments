 * DrawingEditor defines the interface for coordinating
 * the different objects that participate in a drawing editor.
 * <p>
 * For applications with a single document interface (SDI) there is typically 
 * one DrawingEditor instance per document window. So that each window
 * can have its own toolbars and drawing palettes.
 * <p>
 * For applications with a Windows-style multiple document interface (MDI) there
 * is typically one DrawingEditor instance per parent window. All document 
 * windows within a parent window share the toolbars and drawing palettes 
 * provided be the parent window.
 * <p>
 * For applications with a Mac OS X-style application document interface (OSX) 
 * there is typically a single DrawingEditor instance for the application. All
 * document windows within the application share a single set of toolbars and 
 * drawing palettes.
