 FIXME - We only do a flattened path
 Note: This could be extended to use different stroke objects for
 the inner and the outher path.
 XXX - We only support straight line segments here
 Corners of the current and the previous thick line
 Remove duplicate nodes from bezier path.
 Handle the first point of the bezier path
 Handle points in the middle of the bezier path
 Handle the last point of the bezier path
bp.get(1).x[0], bp.get(1).y[0],
 line length
 The x and y increments from an endpoint needed to create a rectangle...
        ddx += (ddx > 0) ? 0.5 : -0.5;
        ddy += (ddy > 0) ? 0.5 : -0.5;
         
 Now we can compute the corner points...
