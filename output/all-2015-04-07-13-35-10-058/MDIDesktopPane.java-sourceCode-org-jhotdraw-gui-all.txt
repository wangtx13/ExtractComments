 * An extension of JDesktopPane that supports often used MDI functionality. This
 * class also handles setting scroll bars for when windows move too far to the left or
 * bottom, providing the MDIDesktopPane is in a ScrollPane.
 * Note by dnoyeb: I dont know why the container does not fire frame close events when the frames
 * are removed from the container with remove as opposed to simply closed with the
 * "x".  so if you say removeAll from container you wont be notified.  No biggie.
