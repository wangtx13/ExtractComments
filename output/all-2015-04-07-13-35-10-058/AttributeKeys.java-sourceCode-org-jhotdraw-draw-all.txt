 * @version 1.2 2006-07-09 Stroke dash factor added. 
 * <br>1.1 2006-06-07 Changed all values to double.
 * <br>1.0 23. 3. 2006 Created.
 
     * Fill color. The value of this attribute is a Color object.
     
         * If WINDING_RULE is set to this value, an even-odd winding rule
         * is used for determining the interior of a path.  
         
         * If WINDING_RULE is set to this value, a non-zero winding rule
         * is used for determining the interior of a path.  
         
     * Fill under stroke. The value of this attribute is a Boolean object.
     
         * If FILL_UNDER_STROKE is set to this value, the area under the
         * stroke will not be filled.
         
         * If FILL_UNDER_STROKE is set to this value, the area under the stroke
         * is filled to the center of the stroke. This is the default behavior
         * of Graphics2D.fill(Shape), Graphics2D.draw(Shape) when using the
         * same shape object.
         
         * If FILL_UNDER_STROKE is set to this value, the area under the
         * stroke will be filled.
         
     * Fill under stroke. The value of this attribute is a Boolean object.
     
     * Stroke color. The value of this attribute is a Color object.
     
     * Stroke width. A double used to construct a BasicStroke or the
     * outline of a DoubleStroke.
     
     * Factor for the stroke inner width. This is a double. The default value
     * is 2.
     
     * Stroke join. One of the BasicStroke.JOIN_... values used to
     * construct a BasicStroke.
     
     * Stroke join. One of the BasicStroke.CAP_... values used to
     * construct a BasicStroke.
     
     * Stroke miter limit factor. A double multiplied by total stroke width,
     * used to construct the miter limit of a BasicStroke.
     
     * An array of doubles used to specify the dash pattern in
     * a BasicStroke;
     
     * A double used to specify the starting phase of the stroke dashes.
     
     * A double used to specify the multiplication factor for the stroke dashes.
     * If this is null, the STROKE_WIDTH is used as the factor.
     
         * If STROKE_TYPE is set to this value, a BasicStroke instance is used
         * for stroking.
         
         * If STROKE_TYPE is set to this value, a DoubleStroke instance is used
         * for stroking.
         
     * Stroke type. The value of this attribute is either VALUE_STROKE_TYPE_BASIC
     * or VALUE_STROKE_TYPE_DOUBLE.
     * FIXME - Type should be an enumeration.
     
         * If STROKE_PLACEMENT is set to this value, the stroke is centered
         * on the path.
         
         * If STROKE_PLACEMENT is set to this value, the stroke is placed
         * inside of a closed path.
         
         * If STROKE_PLACEMENT is set to this value, the stroke is placed
         * outside of a closed path.
         
     * Stroke placement. The value is either VALUE_STROKE_PLACEMENT_INSIDE,
     * VALUE_STROKE_PLACEMENT_OUTSIDE, VALUE_STROKE_PLACEMENT_CENTER.
     * This only has effect for closed paths. On open paths, the stroke
     * is always centered on the path.
     * FIXME - Type should be an enumeration.
     
     * The value of this attribute is a String object, which is used to
     * display the text of the figure.
     
     * Text color. The value of this attribute is a Color object.
     
     * Text shadow color. The value of this attribute is a Color object.
     
     * Text shadow offset. The value of this attribute is a Dimension2DDouble object.
     
     * The value of this attribute is a Font object, which is used as a prototype
     * to create the font for the text.
     
     * The value of this attribute is a double object.
     
     * The value of this attribute is a Boolean object.
     
     * The value of this attribute is a Boolean object.
     
     * The value of this attribute is a Boolean object.
     
     * The value of this attribute is a Liner object.
     
     * The value of this attribute is a Insets2DDouble object.
     
     * The value of this attribute is a Insets2DDouble object.
     
     * Specifies the direction of the triangle. Possible values are
     * NORTH, SOUTH, EAST,
     * WEST.
     
     * A set with all attributes defined by this class.
     
     * Convenience method for computing the total stroke widht from the
     * STROKE_WIDTH, STROKE_INNER_WIDTH and STROKE_TYPE attributes.

     * Returns the distance, that a Rectangle needs to grow (or shrink) to
     * fill its shape as specified by the FILL_UNDER_STROKE and STROKE_POSITION
     * attributes of a figure.
     * The value returned is the number of units that need to be grown (or shrunk)
     * perpendicular to a stroke on an outline of the shape.

     * draw its shape as specified by the FILL_UNDER_STROKE and STROKE_POSITION
     * attributes of a figure.
     * The value returned is the number of units that need to be grown (or shrunk)
     * perpendicular to a stroke on an outline of the shape.
