 Creates a new instance. 
     * If the pressed figure is a TextHolder it can be edited otherwise
     * a new text figure is created.
     
 update view so the created figure is drawn before the floating text
 figure is overlaid. (Note, fDamage should be null in StandardDrawingView
 when the overlay figure is drawn because a JTextField cannot be scrolled)
view().checkDamage();

            beginEdit(textHolder);
