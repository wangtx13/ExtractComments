 * A DefaultOSXApplication can handle the life cycle of multiple document windows each
 * being presented in a JFrame of its own.  The application provides all the
 * functionality needed to work with the document, such as a menu bar, tool bars
 * and palette windows.
 * <p>
 * OSX stands for Mac OS X Application Document Interface. An OSX application can handle
 * multiple Project's at the same time. Each project gets a JFrame of its own.
 * An OSX application has one menu bar, attached to the top of the screen.
 * This 'screen menu bar' is shared by all Project's.
 * <p>
 * DefaultOSXApplication is designed for Mac OS X. It will not work on other
 * platforms.
 * <p>
 * The screen menu bar has the following standard menus:
 * <pre>
 * "Application-Name" File Edit Window Help
 * </pre>
 * The first menu, is the <b>application menu</b>. It has the following standard menu
 * items. DefaultOSXApplication wires the menu items to the action objects
 * specified in brackets. The preferences menu item is only displayed,
 * if the application has an action with PreferencesAction.ID. The other menu
 * items are always displayed. Menu items without action wiring are generated by
 * Mac OS X and can not be changed.
 * <pre>
 *  About "Application-Name" (AboutAction.ID)
 *  -
 *  Preferences... (PreferencesAction.ID)
 *  -
 *  Services
 *  -
 *  Hide "Application-Name"
 *  Hide Others
 *  Show All
 *  -
 *  Quit "Application-Name" (ExitAction.ID)
 * </pre>
 * The <b>file menu</b> has the following standard menu items.
 * DefaultOSXApplication wires the menu items to the action objects
 * specified in brackets. If the application hasn't an action with the
 * specified ID, the menu item is not displayed. Menu items without action
 * wiring are generated by this class, and can be changed by subclasses.
 * <pre>
