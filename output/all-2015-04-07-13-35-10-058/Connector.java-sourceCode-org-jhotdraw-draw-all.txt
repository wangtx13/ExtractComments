 * Connectors know how to locate a connection point on a figure.
 * A Connector knows its owning figure and can determine either
 * the start or the endpoint of a given connection figure. A connector
 * has a display box that describes the area of a figure it is
 * responsible for. A connector can be visible but it doesn't have
 * to be.<br>

     * Finds the start point for the connection.
     
     * Finds the end point for the connection.
     
     * Gets the connector's owner.
     
     * Gets the display box of the connector.
     
     * Gets the anchor of the connector.
     * This is a point at the center or at the bounds of the figure, where
     * the start or the end point will most likely be attached.
     * The purpose of this method is to give the user a hint, where the 
     * connector will most likely be attached to the owner of the connector.
     
     * Updates the anchor of the connector.
     * This method is called when the user manually changes the end point of
     * the ConnectionFigure. The Connector can use this as a hint, where
     * the user wants to place the start or end point of the ConnectionFigure.
     
     * Tests if a point is contained in the connector.
     
     * Draws this connector. Connectors don't have to be visible
     * and it is OK leave this method empty.
     
     * Returns a clone of the Connection.
