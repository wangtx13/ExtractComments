 * Figures to connect Connectors provided by Figures.
 * A ConnectionFigure knows its start and end Connector.
 * It uses the Connectors to locate its connection points.<p>
 * A ConnectionFigure can have multiple bezier segments. It provides
 * operations to split and join bezier segments.

 CONNECTING
	 * Sets the start Connector of the connection.
         * Set this to null to disconnect the start connection.
	 * @param start the start figure of the connection
	 
	 * Gets the start Connector.
         * Returns null, if there is no start connection.
	 
	 * Sets the end Connector of the connection.
         * Set this to null to disconnect the end connection.
	 * @param end the end figure of the connection
	 
	 * Gets the end Connector.
         * Returns null, if there is no end connection.
	 
	 * Updates the connection.
         * FIXME - What das this do?
	 
	 * Checks if two figures can be connected using this ConnectionFigure.
         * Implement this method to constrain the allowed connections between figures.
	 
	 * Checks if this ConnectionFigure can be attached to the provided 
         * start figure.
         * This is used to provide an early feedback to the user, when he/she
         * creates a new connection.
	 
     * Checks if the ConnectionFigure connects the same figures.
         *
         * FIXME - What do we need this for?
     
	 * Sets the start point.
	 
	 * Sets the end point.
	 
	 * Sets the specified point.
	 
	 * Gets the point count.
	 
         * Returns the specified point.
         
	 * Gets the start point.
	 
	 * Gets the end point.
	 
	 * Gets the start figure of the connection.
         * This is a convenience method for doing getStartConnector().getOwner()
         * and handling null cases.
	 
	 * Gets the end figure of the connection.
         * This is a convenience method for doing getEndConnector().getOwner()
         * and handling null cases.
	 
 COMPOSITE FIGURES
     * Get a Liner object which encapsulated a lineout
     * algorithm for this figure. Typically, a Liner
     * accesses the child components of this figure and arranges
     * their graphical presentation.
        *
     * @return lineout strategy used by this figure
     
     * A lineout algorithm is used to define how the child components
     * should be laid out in relation to each other. The task for
     * lineouting the child components for presentation is delegated
     * to a Liner which can be plugged in at runtime.
     
     * Set a Liner object which encapsulated a lineout
     * algorithm for this figure. Typically, a Liner
     * accesses the child components of this figure and arranges
     * their graphical presentation. It is a good idea to set
     * the Liner in the protected initialize() method
     * so it can be recreated if a GraphicalCompositeFigure is
     * read and restored from a StorableInput stream.
     *
     *
     * @param newValue	encapsulation of a lineout algorithm.
