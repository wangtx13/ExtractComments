 * A CompositeFigure is composed of several child Figures.
 * A CompositeFigure can be laid out using a Layouter.

     * The value of this attribute is a Insets2DDouble object.
     
     * Adds a child to the figure.
     * This is a convenience method for add(getChildCount(), child);
     
     * Adds a child to the figure at the specified index.
     
     * Adds a child to the figure without firing events.
     * This is a convenience method for basicAdd(getChildCount(), child);
     
     * Adds a child to the figure at the specified index without
     * firing events.
     
     * Removes the specified child.
     * Returns true, if the Figure contained the removed child.
     
     * Removes the child at the specified index.
     * Returns the removed child figure.
     
     * Removes all children from the composite figure.
     
     * Removes the specified child without firing events.
     * Returns true, if the Figure contained the removed child.
     
     * Removes the child at the specified index without firing events.
     * Returns the removed child figure.
     
     * Removes all children from the composite figure without firing events.
     
     * Returns an unchangeable list view on the children.
     
     * Returns the number of children.
     
     * Returns the child figure at the specified index.
     
     * Get a Layouter object which encapsulated a layout
     * algorithm for this figure. Typically, a Layouter
     * accesses the child components of this figure and arranges
     * their graphical presentation.
        *
     * @return layout strategy used by this figure
     
     * A layout algorithm is used to define how the child components
     * should be laid out in relation to each other. The task for
     * layouting the child components for presentation is delegated
     * to a Layouter which can be plugged in at runtime.
     
     * Set a Layouter object which encapsulated a layout
     * algorithm for this figure. Typically, a Layouter
     * accesses the child components of this figure and arranges
     * their graphical presentation. It is a good idea to set
     * the Layouter in the protected initialize() method
     * so it can be recreated if a GraphicalCompositeFigure is
     * read and restored from a StorableInput stream.
     *

     * @param newValue	encapsulation of a layout algorithm.
