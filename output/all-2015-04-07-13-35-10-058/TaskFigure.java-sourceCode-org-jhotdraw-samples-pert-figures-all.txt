     * This adapter is used, to connect a TextFigure with the name of
     * the TaskFigure model.
     
 We could fire a property change event here, in case
 some other object would like to observe us.
target.firePropertyChange("name", e.getOldValue(), e.getNewValue());

 Creates a new instance. 
 The if-statement here guards against
 cyclic task dependencies. 
     * Returns dependent PertTasks which are directly connected via a
     * PertDependency to this TaskFigure.
     
     * Returns predecessor PertTasks which are directly connected via a
     * PertDependency to this TaskFigure.
     
     * Returns true, if the current task is a direct or
     * indirect dependent of the specified task.
     * If the dependency is cyclic, then this method returns true
     * if <code>this</code> is passed as a parameter and for every other
     * task in the cycle.
