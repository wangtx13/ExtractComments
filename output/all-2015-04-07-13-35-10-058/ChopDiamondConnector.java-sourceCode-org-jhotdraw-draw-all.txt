 only used for Storable implementation
     * Return an appropriate connection point on the edge of a diamond figure
     
 FIXME - This code is wrong. Copy correct code from DiamondFigure.
growy = getStrokeTotalWidth() * SQRT2;
growx = growy = getStrokeTotalWidth() / 2d * SQRT2;
 Center point
 If overlapping, just return the opposite corners
 Calculate angle to determine quadrant
 Dermine line points
 This will be returned
 Get the intersection with edges
 No proper edge found, we should send one of four corners
