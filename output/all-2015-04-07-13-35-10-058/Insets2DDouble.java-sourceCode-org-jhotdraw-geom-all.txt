     * The inset from the left.
     * This value is added to the Left of the rectangle
     * to yield a new location for the Left edge.

     * The inset from the bottom.
     * This value is subtracted from the Bottom of the rectangle

     * Creates and initializes a new <code>Insets2DDouble</code> object with the 
     * 0 insets. 
     * <p>
     * This constructor is required by the DOMStorable interface.
     
     * Creates and initializes a new <code>Insets2DDouble</code> object with the 
     * specified top, left, bottom, and right insets. 
     * @param       top   the inset from the top.
     * @param       left   the inset from the left.
     * @param       bottom   the inset from the bottom.
     * @param       right   the inset from the right.
     
     * Checks whether two insets objects are equal. Two instances 
     * of <code>Insets2DDouble</code> are equal if the four integer values
     * of the fields <code>top</code>, <code>left</code>, 
     * <code>bottom</code>, and <code>right</code> are all equal.
     * @return      <code>true</code> if the two insets are equal;
     *                          otherwise <code>false</code>.
     * @since       JDK1.1
     
     * Returns the hash code for this Insets2DDouble.

     * @return    a hash code for this Insets2DDouble.
     
     * Returns a string representation of this <code>Insets2DDouble</code> object. 
     * This method is intended to be used only for debugging purposes, and 
     * the content and format of the returned string may vary between 
     * implementations. The returned string may be empty but may not be 
     * <code>null</code>.
     * 
     * @return  a string representation of this <code>Insets2DDouble</code> object.
     
     * Create a copy of this object.
     * @return     a copy of this <code>Insets2DDouble</code> object.
     
 this shouldn't happen, since we are Cloneable
     * Initialize JNI field and method IDs
